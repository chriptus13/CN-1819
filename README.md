# CN-1819

This repository contains the implementation for Cloud Computing [labs](/Labs) and a final project [CNPhotos](/Trabalho-Final) which allows storing and catalog by a set of identified characteristics submitted images using GCP Vision API.

These labs and project were solved in Computação na Nuvem (Cloud Computing) subject in [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt) during my degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
